# DRuP (Didactic Reduced microProcessor)

This a _Verilog_ description of a 4-bit didactic procesor developed at Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas (Bogotá, Colombia) in the ARMOS research group. The main goal of the project is teaching the basic concepts of microprocessors by means of a simplified hardware description able to be implemented on small programable logic devices.
